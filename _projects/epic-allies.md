<p>I created art and designs for a prototypical version of a mobile health app called <em>Epic Allies</em> while working for <a href="http://caktusgroup.com">Caktus Group</a>. The goal of the application was to encourage young men with HIV to take their daily medication through gamification. Research was conducted by a partnership between Duke University and UNC Chapel Hill to conduct tests on whether gamification increased the likelihood of participants taking their meds. My role at Caktus was working on designing the game, creating art assets for it, and providing front-end code (styles, animations, etc) that was performant on mobile phones.</p>

<h2>Mood Boards</h2>
<p>Pinterest was leveraged for maintaining moodboards for this project because of its ability to loosely scrapbook ideas. We maintained a mixture of images pulled from around the web and our own drawings to augment the overall feel. This task is really what Pinterest was meant for, and when multiple members of a team share a pinboard, ideas solidify very quickly. Without Pinterest, we would have ended up with a very different art style.</p>

<h2>Logo Designs</h2>
<p><em>Epic Allies</em> passed through multiple iterations including a number of name changes. Each time we started fresh, I came up with a few logo options; this helped set the tone for the project. The final logo was created in Blender and rendered in Cycles</p>

<h2>Background Paintings</h2>
    <p>Backgrounds were created completely in Photoshop. The technique employed was a mixture of vector masks and raster fills to give the graphics a paper cutout look but minus the shadows so that it was flat, but textured.</p>
